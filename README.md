# Comparison between “sister cities” and “air routes” graphs

## Motivation

Town-twinning is a particular relationship stipulated between two localities, whose goal is to promote a mutual enrichment of cultural, diplomatic, social and/or economic nature. The fact that such agreement is not exclusive allows city administrations to negotiate more relations of this kind, more likely on an international level. All these links build a dense and capillary network between cities across the world.

A “sister city” bond often materializes in trading opportunities and cultural exchanges, encouraging travels that put in contact citizens and companies from different localities. For example, Boston University fosters study abroad programs for college students in the twinned city of Padua. At this point, a question rises: do these partnerships have any influence on the intensity of air traffic between sister cities (taking into account the fact that generally some destinations have to be reached through one or more stopovers)?

The purpose of the project is to analyze two graphs:

1. The first of them is representative of the network of twinning relations around the globe, where each vertex stands for a city. All the necessary data for its implementation       will be extracted by executing a SPARQL query using the Wikidata’s Query Service, since no raw dataset concerning this topic has been found.

2. The second graph depicts a global mapping of all the airline routes connecting different cities, weighted with the amount of flights during a certain time lapse. The dataset       that will be used for its implementation is available at the following link: https://data.world/tylerudite/airports-airlines-and-routes .

From the comparison of the features computed on both these two graphs, the aim is to observe if there is any similarity between them.
