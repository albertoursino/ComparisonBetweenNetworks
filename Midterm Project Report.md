## **Notes**
The main objective of this project is not changed: we're aiming to finding similiraties between the "sister citi.

We introduced a new experiement, that is the one relative to the *nations graphs*.

During the start of the project we encountered some small issues with the datasets: some city names are written is different ways in the two datasets.
For example we find `Tel Aviv` in the sister cities dataset and `Tel-aviv` in the airline routes one.
Thi issue does not allow us to compare the two graphs directly. For this, we had to implement a sort of **normalization** to the data and thus create "reduced" graphs; "reduced" because we inevitably lost some nodes. Of course this part can be optimized in the future.
