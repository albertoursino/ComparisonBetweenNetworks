## **Notes**
The main objective of this project is not changed: we're aiming to find similarities between the "sister cities" and "airline routes" graphs.

During the start of the project we encountered some small issues with the datasets: some city names are written in different ways.
For example we find `Tel Aviv` in the sister cities dataset and `Tel-aviv` in the airline routes one.
Thi issue does not allow us to compare the two graphs directly. For this, we had to implement a sort of **normalization** to the data and thus create "reduced" graphs; "reduced" because we inevitably lost some nodes. Of course this part can be optimized in the future.

Nice images of the plotted graphs can be found in the above links.
